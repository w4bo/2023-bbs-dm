## This course

This course provides an introduction to the base principles and methods of Data Mining and Machine Learning, with particular reference to Classification, Clustering, Association Rules, Outliers discovery. It also focuses on the analysis of the major problems related to data quality and data transformation. It features the use of Python to solve data mining and machine learning problems.
 
**Teaching Method(s)**: The theoretical background and the discussion of the principles are introduced in class with presentation of slides and stimulating discussions with the students. The methods are then applied with lab exercises. Team works are assigned, a final report will be discussed in class.
